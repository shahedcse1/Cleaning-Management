                                    <p> If you have bed bugs in your house, the only thing on your mind will be getting rid of them as quickly as possible. Bed bugs stay close to a food source, so are found where people tend to rest and sleep, hence the name bed bug.  The frustration they can cause is not only due to the emotional stress of dealing with parasites, but also the irritation of their bites and the potential for secondary infection from constant scratching.
                                        There has been a recent resurgence of bed bugs in homes biting people at night.  It is widely thought that this is related to a global increase in international travel (bed bugs are known to travel in luggage or clothing). We understand how distressing bed bugs can be. Call us free and we’ll get rid of your problem.

                                            Bed bugs are a potential risk for any business. However, organisations offering accommodation, like hotels, and transportation face a much higher risk of infestations.
                                            In these highly frequented environments, early detection and fast, effective bed bug control solutions are critical to ensure your business experiences the minimum amount of disruption.

                                            The first step to solving any pest problem is to know what pest you are dealing with. In this case, you need to be sure you have bed bugs and not another biting insect such as mosquitoes or fleas. Pest control services and solutions vary depending on the species infesting your home or business.
                                            Bed bugs are nocturnal, only coming out at night to feed, which makes them difficult to spot. During the day they tend to hide in cracks and crevices near their preferred feeding area (usually a bed). If you can identify the common signs of bed bugs, it will help to confirm if there is an infestation present in your premises.
                                            If you decide to control bed bugs on your own, there are a few steps you can take straight away to try and manage a small bed bug problem.
