                                        Everyone knows how annoying – and painful – midges and mosquitoes can be. Somehow, no matter how many you manage to swat, there always seem to be some that manage to get through to give you a nasty, itchy bite or two.Here are some facts that you might want to know about these nasty little insects:<br>
                                        They can develop from eggs to adults in just six to ten days.<br>
                                        They are found close to still water, where their larvae feed and develop.<br>
                                        They seem to be attracted to dark colours.<br>
                                        Mosquitoes will normally bite you at dawn or dusk – or if you’re unlucky, both. That’s when their internal clocks tell them it's feeding time.<br>
                                    </p>

                                            Mosquitoes and midges can make life unpleasant. Constantly having to track down that high-pitched whine can be a pain. And when you’ve found the culprit there always seems to be another one waiting in the wings.So why is your home or business particularly attractive to mosquitoes and how can you be sure of mosquito identification?

                                            If your business has a mosquito problem you’ll want to get rid of it quickly. It’s not only a nuisance for your staff, but it could be bad for your bottom line. The last thing customers want is to be bitten on your premises, and it could damage your reputation.
                                            Although it’s rare to catch any disease from mosquitoes in the UK (the last reported instance being in 1952 in Kent), it is still possible. A species of mosquito suspected of transmitting West Nile virus to humans in Europe was discovered in the marshes of north Kent and south Essex in 2012.

                                            Mosquitoes get a bad press, but to be honest they deserve it. There are few things more annoying when you’re trying to get to sleep than the high-pitched whine of mosquitoes in your room. You just know that they will bite you at some point in the night.

                                            Mosquitoes can be a real nuisance, leaving you with nasty itchy bites. Those bites all come from the female. The male mosquito prefers to feed on nectar and other sweet things.

                                            How do you get rid of mosquitoes in your home for good? If the infestation is small then the first thing you should try is our DIY products. These are highly effective when the problem isn’t too bad, but if it gets worse or keeps coming back then you’ll need to call in the experts.
